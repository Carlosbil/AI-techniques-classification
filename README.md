This repository is made to practice and make projects for this subject, do not use or copy this code for anything other than learning.

Used python 3.8 and `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to install dependencies in order to execute properly this file. Maybe some packages are not used, this is because I am working on 4-5 projects at the same time and I have created a requirements.txt for all of them.
